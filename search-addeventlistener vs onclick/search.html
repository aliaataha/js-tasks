    <!-- addEventListener
          addEventListener can add multiple events to a particular element.
          ddEventListener can take a third argument that can control the event propagation.
          addEventListener can only be added within <script> elements or in external JavaScript file.
          addEventListener does not work in older versions of Internet explorer, which uses attachEvent instead.
  
  onclick
  
         onclick can add only a single event to an element. It is basically a property, so gets overwritten.
         Event propagation cannot be controlled by onclick.
         onclick can be added as an HTML attribute also.
         onclick works in all browsers. -->
